          Main Objective
        </div>
        <div class="section-info">
          <p>Checkers is played on a standard 64 square board (8*8: American). Only the 32 dark colored squares are used in
            play. Each player begins with 12 pieces or checkers, placed initially on their side of the board.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The objective of the game is to capture all of your opponents checkers or position your pieces such that your opponent
            has no available moves left.</p>
        </div>

      <!-- SECTION ON MOVEMENT -->

          Basic Movement
        </div>
        <div class="section-info">
          <p>Basic Movement is to move a checker one space diagonally forward. You cannot move a checker (also referred to as
            the warrior piece) backwards unless it becomes a king piece (more info on this below). If a jump is available
            you must take the jump as described in the section below.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <!-- SECTION ON JUMPING -->
      <div class="instructions-section">
        <div class="section-title">Jumping</div>
        <div class="section-info">
          <p>If one of your opponents checkers is on a forward diagonal next to one of your checkers, and the next space in
            the same direction is empty, then your checker must jump the opponents checkers and land in the space beyond.
            Your opponent's checker is captured and removed from the board.</p>
          <br>
          <p>After making one jump, your checker might have another jump available from its new position. Your checker must
            make that jump too. It must continue to jump until there are no more jumps left. Both warrior and king are allowed
            to take multiple jumps.</p>
          <br>
          <p>If at the start of a turn, more than one of your checkers has a jump available, then you may decide which one you
            will move. But once you have chosen one, it must make all the jumps that it can.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <!-- SECTION ON CROWNING -->
      <div class="instructions-section">
        <div class="section-title">Crowning</div>
        <div class="section-info">
          <p>When one of your checkers reaches the opposite end of the board, it is crowned and becomes a king. Your turn ends
            there.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>A king can move backward as well as forward along the diagonals. It can only move a distance of one space.</p>
          <br>
          <p>A king can also jump backward and forward. It must jump when possible, and it must take all the jumps that are
            available with each turn.</p>
